# Node.js Game Shop: A CRUD App Tutorial

This Node.js application was developed as part of a course aimed at understanding the fundamentals of building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The project specifically focuses on creating a mini shop for games, providing a practical way to comprehend the essential aspects of Node.js development.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Node.js Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of Node.js, including event-driven architecture, modules, and asynchronous programming.
- **Express.js Integration**: Learn how to utilize Express.js to create a robust and scalable web application.
- **CRUD Operations**: Gain hands-on experience with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in the context of a web application.
- **API Design and Implementation**: Explore API design principles and implement them in the context of a game shop application.
- **Database Interactions**: Learn how to interact with a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store and retrieve data for the application.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API**: Implements a RESTful API to allow clients to perform CRUD operations on game data.
- **Database Storage**: Utilizes a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store game information, demonstrating database integration with Node.js.
- **Express.js Server**: Sets up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate handlers.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete game records through API endpoints.

## Implementation Details

- **Node.js Backend**: Implements the backend of the application using Node.js, focusing on modularity and maintainability.
- **Express.js Integration**: Utilizes Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests to various endpoints.
- **Database Interaction**: Demonstrates integration with a database (e.g., MongoDB) for persistent data storage and retrieval.
- **API Design and Routes**: Defines API routes following RESTful principles and ensures proper handling of requests.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB) and configure the application to connect to it.
4. Run the application using `node server.js`.
5. Use an API testing tool (e.g., Postman) to interact with the CRUD operations for games.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed to enhance understanding of Node.js and its application in building a CRUD-based mini shop for games. Special thanks to the course instructor and fellow learners for their guidance and collaboration throughout the course.
